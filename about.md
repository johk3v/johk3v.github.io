Welcome to my page. I started this as sort of a way to learn a little bit of programming and also publish my works, whatever that may be.

I have a ton of interests, as you've likely seen already on my site. I love staying active, playing hockey, soccer, and golf whenever possible. In my downtime, I spend time with my family, look for photoshoot opportunities, or do my best to further my career.

Ideally this site will host a few things:
* Professional Projects
* Photography/Video Projects
* Blog Posts
* Miscellaneous Hoopla

I'll try to keep my discussion and posting to a neutral topic to induce discussion.

I'm sure you'll come across part of the site that's unfinished... I'm working on it, I promise.
