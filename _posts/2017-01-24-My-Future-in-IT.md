So, this is again new to me. I actually might end up going back to school because I'm not seeing enough opportunity here in the Networking/Network Security field. It could partially be lack of effort, however I don't think where I'm at now is going to further my goals and career.

Maybe starting fresh would help. I've been opening my eyes to all opportunities out there. Even if it's a little off the beaten path. Part of me wonders if it will be worth it to go back to school. I've been considering it almost entirely based on the mass amount of programming jobs I see. My cousin, who works as a programmer seems like he enjoys it.
